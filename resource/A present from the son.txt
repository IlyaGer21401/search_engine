				A present from the son
Long ago there lived an old woman in England. She had a son who was a sailor. 
He went to different countries and always brought presents for his old mother.
Once he went to China and brought some tea from that country. 
At that time tea was very expensive and only rich people could buy and drink it. 
So the old woman was very happy to have such a nice present. 
But she didn’t know what to do with it as she had never bought tea before. 
She thought it was a vegetable. She told her friends about her son’s present and invited them to taste it with her. 
At last the day of the tea-party came. 
The woman called her guests to the dining-room and put a big dish of tea leaves on the table. 
The guests began to eat the leaves with salt just as they ate vegetables. 
Nobody liked it but didn’t tell the woman about it and continued to eat the leaves.
Some tome later the sailor came into the room. When he saw that all the guests were eating leaves, he smiled.
“What are you doing? Why are eating these leaves? Where is the tea?” “Here it is, my son,” the old woman said. 
“And where is the water in which you have boiled the leaves?” asked the man laughing. 
“I threw it away, of course,” answered the woman.
